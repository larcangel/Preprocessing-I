    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Lisa is based out of Denver, Co. She spent her early days on Maui, Hi. She
      has a bachelor's degree in business entrepreneurship and management and
      associates in culinary. She is currently a UX/UI student at Lambda
      school.<br />
      Lisa was a business owner of a Crossfit gym in Denver, Co and a chef from
      coast to coast. She is a natural team player and values collaboration but
      a workhorse on solo projects.<br />
      She has always felt happy in her career and achieved everything she wanted
      from it but wanted more. She has a desire for growth and expansion
      regardless of temporary discomfort. She’s comfortable with being
      uncomfortable.<br />
      Curiosity in design brought her into this new passion. An area for growth
      and a display of her creativity and love for new challenges.<br />
      Outside of design, Lisa is a Crossfit and a nutrition coach. She finds
      inspiration in helping others reach their goals. She’s always finding new
      ways to be better, a better designer, a better friend, a better person.
